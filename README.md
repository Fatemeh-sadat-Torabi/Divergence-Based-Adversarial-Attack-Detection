# Divergence-Based-Adversarial-Attack-Detection
This repository contains code &amp; description files related to my master thesis. My research focuses on anomaly-based evasion techniques in low-rate DoS, distributed DoS, port scanning, masquerading, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), and poisoning attacks that compromise models by perturbing training data.
